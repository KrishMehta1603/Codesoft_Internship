# Codesoft Internship - README ðŸ”¥

Welcome to the repository for my internship at Codesoft. This document outlines the tasks that were assigned and completed during the internship. 
Each project was designed to enhance practical data science and machine learning skills.

## PROJECTS  ðŸ”¥ 
ðŸŒŸðŸ’« A. Titanic Prediction Model ðŸ’«ðŸŒŸ

Objective:
-Predict the number of survivors in the Titanic disaster using machine learning.

Description:
- The project involved creating a predictive model to determine the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
- Various features such as age, gender, class, and fare were used to train the model.

Tasks Completed:
- Data preprocessing, exploration & Visualization.
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Model training using logistic regression.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.


ðŸŒŸðŸ’« B. Iris Flower Classification ðŸ’«ðŸŒŸ

Objective:
-Classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Description:
- Developed a classification model to identify the species of iris flowers based on their features.
- Used features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Tasks Completed:
- Data exploration and visualization.
- Model training using KMeans.


ðŸŒŸðŸ’«  C. Sales Prediction Using Python ðŸ’«ðŸŒŸ

Objective:- Forecast the sales amount for a product considering various factors.

Description:
- Built a predictive model to forecast sales based on factors like advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
- Linear regression techniques were applied.

Tasks Completed:
- Data collection, preprocessing & visualizing.
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Model training using linear regression.


 ðŸŒŸðŸ’« D. Credit Card Fraud Detection ðŸ’«ðŸŒŸ
 
Objective:
-Identify fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.

Description:
- Developed a classification model to detect fraudulent transactions from genuine ones.
- Used features such as transaction amount, transaction type, etc.

Tasks Completed:
- Data preprocessing and balancing the dataset.
- Model training using logistic regression and random forests.
- The model achieved high precision, recall & f1-score effectively identifying fraudulent transactions.
